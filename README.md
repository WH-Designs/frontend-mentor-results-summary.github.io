## My process

### Built with

- HTML 5
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was an interesting project because it challenged me to think about how to containers can interact with one another and how to align them side by side with room in between

### Continued development

For future projects I want to take into account that the mobile version should come first in the design process, then once I have the mobile version done then I can move onto coding the next sizes up
